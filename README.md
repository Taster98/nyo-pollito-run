# nyo-pollito-run
This is a very simple platform game built with plain JS as a learning purpose project. This game is based on simple 2d canvas and it is very very basic, for now.

## Install and run
To install the game, you should download the <code>.deb</code> file to any place in your linux filesystem, and then install it by the following:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i nyo-pollito-run_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```
This should takes a few seconds.

After installation is complete, you should find the application in your Apps screen, and you could also be able to run it by typing this in your terminal:

```bash
nyo-pollito-run
```

## Quick tutorial
To move the character, use left and right arrow keys; to jump, use space. The purpose is to collect all the chicken pieces, avoiding lava, in order to not make Nyo starving.

## TODO List
- [ ] Add more levels
- [ ] Show keys at the bottom of the screen
- [ ] Add a few more elements for in-game purpose
